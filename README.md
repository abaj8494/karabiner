Here lie my karabiner configurations. 
Some interesting keybindings include:
- hold tab and a comprehensive numpad appears below the right hand
- press left and right arrow keys together to unlock an arrow launcher
    - now, any subsequent key press of the arrows will launch a specific app
    	- i.e. tap up to open brave browser and hold up to open iterm
		- total of 8 configurable apps (tap, or tap and hold)
- many more miscellaneous modifications. check the json file.
