Here lie my karabiner configurations. 
Some interesting keybindings include:
- hold tab and a comprehensive numpad appears below the right hand
- tap left and right arrow keys together to unlock an arrow launcher
    - any subsequent key presses of the arrows will launch a specific app
    	- total of 8 configurable apps (tap, or tap and hold)
- many more miscellaneous modifications. check the json file.
